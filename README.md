# koa-graphql-boilerplate  
a minimal boilerplate for graphql API running on koa, includes graphiql. Standard.js for linting with flowtype for typechecking

I made this because I wanted to bootstrap a graphQL api and all boilerplates were outdated and they were missing ghraphiql.

## npm commands

- **test** runs ava tests
- **build** builds out `src` into a `dist` folder so you can run the server in production without babel-node
- **dev** runs babel-node via nodemon, so all your changes are immediatelly in effect
