# koa-graphql-boilerplate
a minimal boilerplate for graphql API running on koa, includes graphiql. Standard.js for linting with flowtype for typechecking

I made this because I wanted to bootstrap a graphQL api and all boilerplates were outdated and they were missing ghraphiql.

## npm commands

- _test_ runs ava tests
- _build_ builds out `src` into a `dist` folder so you can run the server in production without babel-node
- _dev_ runs babel-node via nodemon, so all your changes are immediatelly in effect
